# iRepairzone NL

Welcome to our GitHub page, here you can find a little more information about us!

iRepairzone NL is a Dutch IT-company that offers its services to private individuals and business customers. We have a wide range of services that we offer.

We mainly focus on giving electronic devices a 'second-chance' we do so by keeping our prices for repairs as low as we can. Why we do it is because we don't like e-waste and a lot of people get told that they should buy a new device when in a lot of cases it's just a sales pitch to buy a new device.

## What does iRepairzone NL do?

So iRepairzone NL focuses on repairs of electronic devices, these vary between phones, laptops, computers, printers and many more devices. (locally)

But besides that we also offer services as: maintaining internal networks, automating internal business programs, writing and creating software as required, cloud storage for small businesses and giving technical advise.
